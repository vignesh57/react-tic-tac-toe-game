# react-tic-tac-toe-game

Created a simple tic-tac-toe game while learning React.js. It was fun!

Just start from this tutorial if you are interested -

What I learnt?

- How are React.js websites developed
- How the Component model helps separate different UI elements, while also allowing reuse.
- How different components communicate with each other, exchange information
- How we can use 'state' to persist data and properties
